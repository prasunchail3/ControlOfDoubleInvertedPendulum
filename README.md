# ControlOfDoubleInvertedPendulum

A double inverted pendulum is stabilized about the vertical by controlling the movement of the cart at the base. LQR control is used as pole placement technique to stabilize the system.
Noise, sampled from multivariate gaussian distribution, is added to the system to check the stability of the system.
